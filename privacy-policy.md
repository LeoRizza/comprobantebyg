# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: August 4, 2025_

## 1. Who we are

This application is developed by Leo Rizza for internal use in automated document generation. The app receives form data from users, generates a PDF file, stores it on Dropbox, and links it to an Airtable record.

## 2. What data we collect

The application may receive and temporarily process the following information:

- Client names
- Sale totals and item details
- Date of the transaction
- Airtable record identifiers
- PDF content generated from user-submitted HTML

**Note:** The app does not collect passwords, payment methods, or sensitive personal data.

## 3. How we use the data

The data is used exclusively to:

- Generate a PDF receipt or sales confirmation
- Store the PDF in Dropbox
- Return a public link to the PDF
- Save that link to the corresponding Airtable record

Data is **not stored or reused** by the server beyond the execution of the request.

## 4. Data sharing

- We do **not** share data with any third parties.
- The PDF link may be publicly accessible if Dropbox sharing is enabled.

## 5. Data retention

We do not store any data on our own servers. All processing is ephemeral (in-memory), and storage is handled by:

- **Dropbox**, where the generated PDFs are saved.
- **Airtable**, where the PDF link is recorded.

You are responsible for managing and securing the contents of your Dropbox and Airtable accounts.

## 6. Security

- The server uses secure HTTPS communication.
- Dropbox and Airtable access tokens are stored securely and not exposed to the public.

## 7. Contact
